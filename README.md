# IOMETE Data-Plane module

Terraform module to create infrastructure on GCP (Google Cloud Platform) for IOMETE Data-Plane.

The module is open-source and available on GitHub: https://github.com/iomete/terraform-gcp-iomete-data-plane

## Data plane installation

### Pre-requisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

### Configure Terraform file

Create a new folder and create a file (e.g. `main.tf`) with the following content:

> **_Important:_**  Update the `cluster_name`, `project_id`, `location`, `zone`, and `lakehouse_bucket_name` values
> according to your configuration.

```hcl
module "iomete-data-plane" {
  source  = "iomete/iomete-data-plane/gcp"
  version = "1.0.0"

  cluster_name          = "my-lakehouse"
  project_id            = "<gcp-project-id>"
  location              = "us-central1"    # Cluster installed region
  zone                  = "us-central1-c" # Cluster installed exact zone
  lakehouse_bucket_name = "<lakehouse-bucket-name>"
}
```

Required variables:

| Name                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Example                                                                                                 |

| **cluster_name**          | A user provided unique cluster name for IOMETE. It should be unique within GCP project and compatible with GCP naming conventions (See: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/naming-resources).                                                                                | my-lakehouse                                                                                            |
| **project_id**            | Your Google Cloud project ID. This is a unique identifier for your project and can be found in the Google Cloud Console.

| **lakehouse_bucket_name** | An empty Google Cloud Storage bucket to store the data for the lakehouse. Go to your project in the Google Cloud Console, navigate to Cloud Storage and create a new bucket. Pay attention to the location of the bucket, it should be the same as the location of the cluster. | Create a bucket in the GCP project. Make sure that bucket is located in the same region as the cluster. |

For all available variables, see the [variables.tf](variables.tf) file.

### Run terraform

Once you have the terraform file, and configured it according to your needs, you can run the following commands to
create the data-plane infrastructure:

```shell
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init --upgrade

# Create a plan to see what resources will be created
terraform plan

# Apply the changes to your AWS account
terraform apply
```

Please, make sure terraform state files are stored on a secure location. State can be stored in a git, S3 bucket, or any
other secure location.
See here [Managing Terraform State â€“ Best Practices & Examples](https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-state) for more
details.
